## CONWAY's GAME OF LIFE IN PYTHON
Really cool i guess.

Just run:

`python3 main.py patternName`
  
The current patterns are:
+ `random`   - just random position for alive cells
+ `glider`   - a siple glider that travel
+ `oline`    - a diagonal line across the screen
+ `square`   - a square..
+ `line`     - an horizontal line across the screen
+ `bar`      - an horizontal 3x1 line in the center
+ `cross`    - a two diagonal lines forming a cross
+ `create`   - set a green cursor and blanck grid to create what you want: move with h,j,k,l draw with i 

### TO FIX:
+ Cell alive touching border problem
+ Make it compatible with windows maybe (i don't really care)
